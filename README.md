# BookmarkChess (2012)

The original version of this GitHub repo hosted the code for BookmarkChess. I deleted it in Dec 2014 after I failed to sell it to both the New York Times and USA Today. 

However, BookmarkChess influenced other popular chess sites, as I was in touch with those sites when I created it. BookmarkChess was influenced by my experience with Yahoo! Chess (2006), Chessmaster (2007), and xboard (2007). See the photos for pedigree.

I wrote the HTML5 chessboard and the board constraints. I used Stockfish for the chess engine and to generate chess puzzles. I used Google's Firebase (web sockets) for real-time game play.
